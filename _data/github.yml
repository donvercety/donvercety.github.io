    Slim is a PHP micro framework that helps you 
    quickly write simple yet powerful web applications 
    and APIs. Slim is easy to use for both beginners 
    and professionals. Slim favors cleanliness over 
    terseness and common cases over edge cases. Its 
    interface is simple, intuitive, and extensively 
    documented â€” both online and in the code itself. 
    Thank you for choosing the Slim Framework for your 
    next project. I think you're going to love it.
